# Duality (name pendng)

## Known bugs
- Drawing sequences are not assigned correctly meaning we cannot get the next drawing

## TODO
- [x] Correctly display waiting/done players in prompt submission
- [x] Transition to next stage if all players have submitted their prompts 
- [ ] Save drawing to database
- [ ] Make waiting/done for players generic so it can be used across stages
- [ ] Make player status generic
- [ ] Add a seperate waiting stage that is displayed after submission of prompt/drawing
